    Apigee Edge is a first-generation, commercial gateway platform. 
    It includes a fully-integrated API Provider experience along with API Consumer 
    management via a [Developer Portal](../../platform-capabilities/developer-portal/).  

    While Apigee Edge comes with a number of different delivery options, 
    newer SaaS deliveries seem to be getting pushed more towards 
    [Apigee X](../apigee-x/).

    Policies for Apigee Edge API Gateways are configured with XML and can be 
    accessed via a UI, CLI, and API.

    Apigee Edge has a few different gateway offerings, including both a microgateway 
    hybrid approach.
